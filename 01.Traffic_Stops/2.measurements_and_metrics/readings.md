Much of working in data science consists of translating your intuition
into quantitative measurements. The NY Times article discusses the
historical circumstances under which unemployment rates were first
measured. Over the years, myriad policy decisions have been made based
on this measurement. While the economy is experiencing record low
unemployment rates, there are other aspects that aren't capture with
this statistic (such as rising inequality). 

2. [New Statistical Methods](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-flawed-statistical-method-was-just-banned-from-a-major-sports-science-journal/)

Once we decide on what we want to measure, we have to construct an
argument using those measurements. Generally, different subject
domains have different norms and standards for what makes a convincing
argument. However, when certain questions remain stubbornly
intractable to existing "standard" analyses, researchers will use
new or nonstandard techniques to try to make their point. Sometimes
these techniques become accepted and sometime they are deemed
unconvincing.
